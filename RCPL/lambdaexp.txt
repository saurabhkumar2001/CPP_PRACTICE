to the get acess to those it is required to make some modifications to the capture lost of expresion 
syntax:

[capture list](parameter)
{
    statement ---1;
    statement ---2;
}

int main(){
    void (*fptr)()=[]{}(cout<<"lambda expresion";3);
    fptr();
    return
}

while writing a lambda expresion , by default there will be no acess to the variable within which the expresion is written 

so to get acess to those variable then is a need to make the following changes in the capture list of the lambda expression
[]:capture nothing
[=]:capture everything by value , it gives only read acess
[&]: capture everything by reference . it gives both read and write acess 
[=,&x] : capture everything by value , and x var by reference
[=x,&] : capture everything by refernce and x by value
